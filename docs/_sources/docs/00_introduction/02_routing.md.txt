# Routing

You can distribute the actions separately using rest_framework_channels' routing system.
Let's check rest_framework_channels' sequence diagram again.

```{eval-rst}
.. uml::

    group channels
        Client -> Consumer: connect
        return accept
    end
    
    group rest_framework_channels
        Client -> Consumer: action

        Consumer -> ActionHandler: action
        return response

        Consumer -> Client: response
    end

    group channels
        Client -> Consumer: disconnect
        return close
    end
```

As you can see the above diagram, The `Consumer` send the actions into `ActionHandler`.
You can define the routing species which `ActionHandler` will recieve the action.

The definition of the routing is also easy due to the almost same as the original django's routing one.
The routing is defined inside the `AsyncAPIConsumer`. Here is the example.

```python
from django.urls import path, re_path
from rest_framework_channels import generics
from rest_framework_channels.consumers import AsyncAPIConsumer
from rest_framework_channels.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework_channels.decorators import async_action

class ChildActionHandler(generics.RetrieveAPIActionHandler):
    serializer_class = TestSerializer
    queryset = TestModel.objects.all()
    permission_classes = (IsAuthenticated,)

    @async_action
    def recieve_path(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return {'path': 'handled'}, 200

    @async_action
    def recieve_repath(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return {'repath': 'handled'}, 200

class ParentConsumer(AsyncAPIConsumer):
    # You can define the routing inside the consumer similar with original django's urlpatterns
    routepatterns = [
        path('test_child_route', ChildActionHandler.as_aaah()),
        re_path(
            r'test_child_route/(?P<pk>[-\w]+)/$',
            ChildActionHandler.as_aaah(),
        ),
    ]
```

There are some differences from the original django's routing system.
First, you should define the routing in `routepatterns` as class argument in the `Consumer`.
The `Consumer` will distribute the action into the correct action's method you defined using this `routepatterns`.
Second, you should pass the `as_aaah()` instead of `as_asgi()` or `as_view()` into the `path` and `re_path`.
`as_aaah()` is class method. `aaah` is abbreviation for **A**sync **A**PI **A**ction **H**andler (not scream ðŸ˜›).  Because this has similar interface with channels `asgi` and django's `view`, you can use the original `path` and `re_path` function in `django.urls`.

```{note}
We do not support the `include` function. Shortly, you can't define the nested routings.
To do this, the separated `ActionHandler` is the workaround.
```
